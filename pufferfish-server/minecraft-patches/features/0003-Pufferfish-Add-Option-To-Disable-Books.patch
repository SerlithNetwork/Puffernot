Subject: [PATCH] Pufferfish Add Option To Disable Books

Books are commonly the target of duping-related exploits. If you
anticipate that your server will be an early target of duping attacks in
the event that new exploits are found, you may want to consider removing
the ability for non-privileged players to edit books. This patch allows
you to easily disable books, should you want to preemptively remove this
functionality before additional exploits are found.
